                            I was born and raised in Hillsborough, New Jersey, where I grew up with my older sister, Corey.
                            Throughout my childhood I always loved competition, whether it be playing Scrabble with my Mom
                            or playing a variety of sports for my town. When I wasn't competing, I always enjoyed spending 
                            time with friends, hiking and camping, and relaxing with my dog. 
                        </p>

                            Not much has changed since then! I am currently a rising Junior at Haverford College, in Ardmore, 
                            Pennsylvania, where I am a member of the Men's Lacrosse Team. Many of my hobbies have remained the 
                            same, but I have recently picked up golfing thanks to my parents, and cooking thanks to my roommate!

                            One passion I discovered in college was computer science. Since I have been introduced to the 
                            world of coding, I am continuously learning new things. I have recently Co-Founded a startup 
                            called AthLink, a social networking service for current and alumni student-athletes.
                            Myself and our developers are working hard to produce a high-quality product that will

                                For my Machine Learning final project, my group implemented Linear Regression and Adaboost 
                            learning models to predict propety pricing in the Boston area. The goal of this project 
                            was to a) comapre the accuracies of the two models, and b) evaluate which features regarding 
                            the properties weighed more in the models' prediction. We found that (not surprisingly) the 
                            AdaBoost model was much more accurate than Linear Regression (~0.9 and ~0.7, respectively). 
                            As for the factors most valued by the models, both weighed the average number of rooms highly, 
                            but differed drastically in their use of other features (or lack thereof).

                                The Big-Int data type that I created was designed to store large values in C-style arrays,
                            where each index held 3 digit values at different memory addresses. It was very difficult to 
                            be able to delete and allocate memory at the appropriate times, especially when implementing 
                            the copy constructor and = operator. This project drastically improved my knowledge and 
                            understanding various concepts regarding memory.

                                For my Data Structures final project, I decided to create a variation of WORDLE. I 
                            first imported 3 CSV files with 3, 4, and 5 letter words to be randomly selected from 
                            and guessed. I used a comparison algorithm to provide feedback at each of the users' 
                            guesses with correct and incorrect letters/ placement of letters. The most difficult 
                            part was dealing with words with repeated letters. I then implemented a Binary Search 
                            Tree to implement a leaderboard.

                                In my first personal project, I created a program that would help me with something I struggle
                            with every day: finding something to eat. It takes in a user-inputted list of available ingredients 
                            and returns a list of potential meals that can be made with them. It uses a Food class with attributes
                            that will help in the sorting/comparison algorithm: meal time, meal name, and ingredients attributes.
